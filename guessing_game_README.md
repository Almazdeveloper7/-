A simple console-based number guessing game written in C++.

The program generates a random number between 1 and 1000, and the player has 10 attempts to guess it.
The program uses the <random> library to generate a random number.
The user is prompted to guess the number.
After each guess, the program gives a hint:
🔼 "Random number is bigger" if the guess is too low.
🔽 "Random number is smaller" if the guess is too high.
If the player guesses the number correctly — they win! 🎉
If they fail after 10 tries — the game ends.
